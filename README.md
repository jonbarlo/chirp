To run the app, get the code. Then go to the models.rb file and change the database URL accordingly. After that, go to irb, require the models file, and run this:

> DataMapper.auto_migrate!
This will create the necessary database. Then in the directory, run this

> ruby chirp.rb
Go to http://localhost:4567 and youâ€™re up and running locally! Of course, you need to register your RPX account and then change login.erb accordingly.
